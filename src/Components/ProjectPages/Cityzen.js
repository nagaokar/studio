                        <p>
                            Cityzen is an online multiplayer city-builder game where players must compete and
                            cooperate to create a masterplan which balances environmental sustainability with social equity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Completed games are uploaded to the Cityzen Hub, a purpose built website enabling communities
                            and officials to view all previously played games with data selection features.            
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Cityzen is conceptualised as a modern method of planning, utilising the Unity game engine and 
                            standard web development languages to formulate a more inclusive approach to city planning.

                        The gameboard is the existing neighbourhood of Collyhurst, an area to be redeveloped under the
                        Northern Gateway regeneration project, a Â£1 billion investment which aims to create a new family-oriented,

                        This MA thesis was completed in partnership with the developers of the Northern Gateway, 
                        Manchester City Council, the Far East Consortium and Farrell's. The aim
                        was to create an engaging, informative and entertaining digital community planning process 
                        which inclusively builds towards a better tomorrow.
