                        <p>
                        For this project, a Machine Learning Algorithm was created in Grasshopper (a visual coding interface built into
                        the 3D modelling software Rhino). Using this, an interface and digital tool was created in which users were able to
                        configure the architectural massing using easily distinguishable sliders based upon the UK government guidance on
                        housing quality.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        This tool was applied for the design of social housing in Manchester, where Design 
                        for Manufacture and Offsite construction was utilised for the construction strategy.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                        The factors that the algorithm was fed included: environmental analysis of the selected site, demography of context and housing shortages, 
                        potential revenue of each unit type (e.g. studio, 2bed1bathroom, 2bed2bathroom, etc.), available structural systems.. etc. <br></br> 
                        This list is limited but, in essence, the programme was designed to reduce the architectural design process and 'quality' to a accounting
                        excersize, where cost/benefit analysis became the design driver.
